## API Endpoints Tested

### Backend Endpoints Verified
- ✅ `GET /users/{id}` - Student details

- Coach performance metrics
- Course reviews and ratings
- Course curriculum modules

### Future Enhancements Needed
1. Real-time data updates
2. Bulk operations from detail pages
3. Advanced filtering and sorting
4. Export functionality
5. Print-friendly views
